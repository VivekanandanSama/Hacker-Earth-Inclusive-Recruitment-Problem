# Hacker-Rank-Inclusive-recruitment-problem
Hackathon solution

This solution scored 99.97 (max score 100) in the Hacker Earth Hackathon for Amazon Business Research Analyst recruitment

The problem is to predict the fitment percent of candidates for the job based on 20 factors. 
There was an additional problem to find the variable that caused the most bias in the recruitment process. 

The solution code contains the data exploration, transformation, feature selection, and statistical model building segments all in one. 
Some interesting parts could be treatment of variables - considering strings as numeric (after transformation, of course), integer as categorical, etc., 
statistical tests to get a basic idea of how the variables interact with each other, and with the target variable, 
transforming the target variable into a more sensible format for building the model and reducing error.

Hope you find this useful.
